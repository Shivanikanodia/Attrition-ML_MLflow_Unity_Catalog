 Employee Attrition Prediction using Mlflow Pipeline

## Problem Statement

Employee retention is critical for organizational success. This project aims to understand why and when employees are most likely to leave an organization. By identifying the key factors driving employee attrition, organizations can implement targeted strategies to improve retention and plan new hiring in advance.

### In this case study, we address the following objectives:

Identify key drivers of employee churn.
Predict when employees are likely to quit.
Provide actionable insights to improve employee retention.

## Dataset Overview
